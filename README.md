# PassiveHandwriting

In brief, the goal of this project is to fully control a 6 degree of freedom robot arm to replicate the trajectories involved in handwriting. This is to facilitate research being done in the School of Kinesiology and Health Studies at Queenâ€™s University. A short abstract is included for background context. 

Previous studies have found that handwriting is an effective strategy for the memorization of unfamiliar text (Naka et al., 1995). For example, when memorizing unfamiliar characters, participants who actively wrote remembered significantly more than participants who read the presented text. One theory is that producing the visual trajectory of the word facilitates encoding, storage, and future recognition. It remains unclear however if production of the movement also contributes to this memory benefit. The goal of this project is to determine if active movement facilitates memory encoding of unfamiliar texts/ images. To do this I/we will design a robot-assisted writing system capable of reproducing human-like writing trajectories.
